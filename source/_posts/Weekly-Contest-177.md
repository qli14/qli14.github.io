Short summary.
* Count the number of days. Take care of the leap year
* Validate binary trees. My solution is just count the number of nodes and see whether it's equal to n - 1. May not be right in general, although AC.
* Closest divisors. The only trick is setting the bound as sqrt(n).
* Basic math.
