DIBL is a short channel effect variable. The applied high drain bias lowers the barrier when the channel is short. It is defined as the shift in the threshold voltage (mV) over the difference in applied drain voltage (in V), as seen in $I_{DS} - V_{GS}$ curves with high and low drain voltage $V_{DS}$.
