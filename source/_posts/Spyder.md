Spyder is a the Scientific PYthon Development Environmentï¼Œ with an interface very similar to that of Matlab.

Use the command

```
pip install spyder
```

to install Spyder after the installation of Python environment.

However, the `Spyder` can't be launched successfully. Instead, `Anaconda` is installed since it comes with `Spyder` and many modules like `numpy` and `matplotlib` can be installed automatically.
