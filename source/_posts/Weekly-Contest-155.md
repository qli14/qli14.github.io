### 1200. Minimum absolute difference

Trivial

### 1201. Ugly number III

Three pointer method for ugly number II.

For this problem, a better method is using binary search to count the number of ugly numbers within a range. Be careful about the duplicates.

#### Binary search template.

#### How to find the leftmost and rightmost answer?

#### Binary search problems.
