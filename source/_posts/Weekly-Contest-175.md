description: (3 / 4) I encountered a strange error in problem 3 - the test case worked out locally but showed error after submission. It seems that other people were in a similar situation. For the last problem, tried the back tracking method and didn't work it out.

### 1346. Check if N and its double exists

Very similar to the two-sum problem. Store the integer to be search in a set (or hashtable if the specific index needs to be tracked).

### 1347. Minimum numbers of steps to make two strings anagram

If the frequency of a letter in string s is larger than that in string t (possibly zero), it must be obtained by one step of operation. 

### 1348. Tweet counts per frequency

> Correct answer in RUN TEST locally, but wrong answer when submitted.

### 1349. Maximum student taking exam

Tried back tracking during the contest but didn't work it out.

A [tutorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-students-taking-exam/discuss/503686/A-simple-tutorial-on-this-bitmasking-problem) on bit masking problem together with dynamic programming.
