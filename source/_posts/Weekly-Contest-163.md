description: (2/4) Stuck in the third problem. The addition idea doesn't work well for some edge cases. Actually, the subtraction idea works well.

### 1260. Shift 2D Grid

Just shift

### 1261. Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree

A typical tree problem. The only trick is finding all the elements in the binary tree ahead.

### 1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three

Addition idea during the contest didn't work well. Instead, think about the minimum sum of elements to be removed.

###  1263. Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location 

No time to try in the contest. Feels difficult.
