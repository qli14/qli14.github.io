The core idea is to maintain a stack with the rightmost element the next greater element of the current one.  [lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/discuss/168311/C%2B%2BJavaPython-O(1))

Monotone stack

* LC 901, Online stock span
* LC 1019, Next greater node in linked list
* LC 739, Daily temperatures
* LC 42, Trapping rain water
* LC 84, Largest rectangle in histogram
* LC 496, Next greater element I
* LC 503, Next Greater Element II
* LC 856, Score of parentheses. Can't solved in the first try.
* LC 907, Sum of subarray minimums. 
  The key point is how to avoid duplicate counting.
* LC 1130, Minimum cost tree from leaf values.
* LC 828, Unique letter string
* LC 89, Sum of subsequence widths. A pure math problem
*
