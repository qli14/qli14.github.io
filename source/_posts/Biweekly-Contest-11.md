description: (3/4) Solved the first three problems. Around 40 mins left for the last one, still no idea.
---

### 1228. Missing number in arithmetic progression

Trivial

### 1229. Meeting scheduler.

Solved with brute-force and TLE. Optimized by eliminating unnecessary comparison and searching, AC.

Any better solution for this problem.

### 1230. Toss strange coins

Solved with dp.

### 1231. Divide chocolate

No idea.

Binary search.

Similar to 

* 1011, Capacity to ship packages within D days. (I studied this problem before, but still difficult to think of the binary search during contest)
* 875, Koko eating bananas. (Studied this problem before)
* 410, Split array largest sum
* 774, Minimize max distance to gas station

Question: Why is the found value guaranteed to be the sum of a subarray? How to justify this?
