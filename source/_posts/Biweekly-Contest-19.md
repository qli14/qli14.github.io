description: I have skipped three contests in the past two weeks. Biweekly contest 18, Weekly contest 173 and 174. This week, I moved to Ann Arbor and got to join both contests on Saturday. (4/4) The first and third problem are quite straightforward, with no specific algorithm included. The second one is about the prefix subarray and the last one is a typical BFS problem with memorization to excluded repeat visiting.

### 1342. Number of steps to reduce a number to zero

Just code it.

### 1343. Number of sub-arrays of size K and average greater than or equal to threshold

Prefix sum. A trick is to initiate the prefix list as [0]. 

### 1344. Angle between hands of a clock

Just code it.

### 1345. Jump game IV

BFS and avoid repeated visit by tracking the visited groups.
