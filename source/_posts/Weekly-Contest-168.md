### 1298. Maximum candies you can get from boxes

The initial boxes are immediately available and can be opened. In others words, you are provided the keys to initial boxes. A natural thought will be getting all the keys and all the boxes that have been visited. The candies in a box is available if the box has been visited and its key has been obtained or the box is open initially.

The code doesn't work.
