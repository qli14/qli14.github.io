The main idea of Method of Moments (MoM) can be described as:

1. Find the integral equation for a certain problem, with the unknown variable included in the integrand. Green's function method is commonly used in this process, especially for electromagnetic (EM) problems.
2. Approximate the integral equation to obtain a matrix form 
   $$A\cdot{x}=b$$
3. Solve the unknown variable $x​$ from the matrix equation by calculating the inverse of the matrix $A​$.
   $$x=A^{-1}{\cdot}b$$
